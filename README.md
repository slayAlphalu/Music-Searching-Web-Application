# Music-Searching-Web-Application
Using google cloud as engine. Combine the power of flask and python to build a virtual searching engine.

# Overview of Project 1

We build a substantial real-world database application of music.  This project is split into three parts:

* [Part 1](./part1.md): come up with a web application and design the database on paper using ER-modeling.
* [Part 2](./part2.md): implement your database by translating your model into a database schema and example data.
* [Part 3](./part3.md): implement an application that accesses and modifies your database.

Pick an application that you will enjoy working with, because you will be working on it for a substantial part of the semester!  
Try to pick an application that can be populated with real data, since it will make the application more interesting.

You will implement your web application Google Cloud.  You'll be able to share the URL with your friends.  It'll be awesome.   See [programming.md](./programming.md) for details.
